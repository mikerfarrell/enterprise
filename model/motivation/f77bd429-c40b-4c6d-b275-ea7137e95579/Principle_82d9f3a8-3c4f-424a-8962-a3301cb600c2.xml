    documentation="Statement:&#xD;&#xA;Development of applications used across the enterprise is preferred over the development of similar or duplicative applications which are only provided to a particular organization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rationale:&#xD;&#xA;Duplicative capability is expensive and proliferates conflicting data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Implications:&#xD;&#xA;Organizations which depend on a capability which does not serve the entire enterprise must change over to the replacement enterprise-wide capability. This will require establishment of and adherence to a policy requiring this. &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Organizations will not be allowed to develop capabilities for their own use which are similar/duplicative of enterprise-wide capabilities. In this way, expenditures of scarce resources to develop essentially the same capability in marginally different ways will be reduced. &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Data and information used to support enterprise decision-making will be standardized to a much greater extent than previously. This is because the smaller, organizational capabilities which produced different data (which was not shared among other organizations) will be replaced by enterprise-wide capabilities. The impetus for adding to the set of enterprise-wide capabilities may well come from an organization making a convincing case for the value of the data/information previously produced by its organizational capability, but the resulting capability will become part of the enterprise-wide system, and the data it produces will be shared across the enterprise.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
